# DisMineBridge

DisMineBridge is a powerful management and moderation plugin for **Minecraft Java (Paper 1.21.8)**.  
It connects your Minecraft server with a Discord server and provides a unified system for communication, moderation, and administration.

---

## General Information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin delivers a complete and synchronized moderation system for both Minecraft and Discord.

DisMineBridge includes:
- Temporary bans and mutes, fully synchronized with **Simple Voice Chat**  
  (voice mutes and chat mutes stay perfectly aligned).
- Warnings and kicks.
- An advanced **Admin Mode**:
  - Automatically stores your entire inventory in the database.
  - Switches you to Creative Mode for administrative work.
  - Restores your previous inventory, location, and game mode perfectly once disabled.
- A professional **Vanish System** with hidden join/quit messages.
- A **Maintenance Mode** restricting access to permitted players only.
- A built-in **whitelist system**.
- MOTD management directly through the plugin configuration — no manual server editing required.

> [!NOTE]
> One of the main goals of this project is to eliminate the lack of synchronized moderation between Discord and Minecraft.
