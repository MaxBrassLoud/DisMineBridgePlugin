<h1>DisMineBridge</h1>
<hr><p>DisMineBridge is a Minecraft Java Plugin for Paper 1.21.8. It makes a Connection between a Minecraft server and a discord server.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>This plugin delivers a complete moderation and management system for your server. You can temporarily ban or mute players — fully integrated with Simple Voice Chat, ensuring that voice mutes and text mutes stay perfectly synchronized. Warnings and kicks are also supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>An advanced Admin Mode is included as well: when activated, your entire inventory is safely stored in the database, you are switched to Creative Mode, and can work without interruptions. When you disable the mode, your original location, game mode, and inventory are restored exactly as before — as if you were never in Admin Mode.</p>
<p>The plugin also features an enhanced vanish system that lets you operate completely unseen, including hidden join and quit messages.</p>
<p>Server management is covered too: a Maintenance Mode restricts access to selected players only, and an integrated whitelist system completes the access and security features.
Additionally, the plugin allows you to customize your server’s MOTD directly through its configuration — no manual editing of the server software required.</p><ul>
